Previous sections have presented the motivation of this work, a vocabulary designed on top of the 
RDF Data Cube Vocabulary for modellling quantitative indexes and a Java-SPARQL based processor 
to validate and compute any kind of index. According to the requirements and features 
of quantitative indexes an initial evaluation is presented in Table~\ref{tab:eval-rdfindex} to show 
how the application of semantic technologies can ease indexes management and their computation process.

Furthermore it is relevant to remark that data quality and filtering is currently a big challenge 
due to the vast amount of data that is continuosly being generated. Policy-makers as agents in charge 
of making decissions must be able to manage~\footnote{http://fcw.com/articles/2013/06/11/data-performance-management.aspx} 
this information in a timely and flexible fashion. In this context semantic technologies provides the adequate and standarized building blocks, see Table~\ref{tab:eval-steps}, 
to improve the dynamism and updating capabilities of policy-maker tools. Neverthless 
the initial effort to translate existing index definitions and computation processes to this approach can 
be hard and time-consuming but going beyond of that further updates and tools can perfectly benefit from this effort as 
other ``semantized'' domains have already done FIXME: medical, etc.
